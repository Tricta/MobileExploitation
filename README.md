Welcome to my Mobile Exploitation repository, here is my collection of all challenges/CTFs that I found and resolve for having fun and learn more about these fields.

I will put on the repository the APK analyzed and the Write-Up( in .pdf or on the README of each repository).

If you want to send some challenge for me to solve, have some tip or resource to I study, or want to ask some question, please check out my profile and contact me.
